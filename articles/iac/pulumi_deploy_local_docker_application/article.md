# Deploying a Python Application in Docker Using Pulumi

## I. Introduction

- **Overview of Python applications** and their deployment challenges.
- **Brief introduction to Docker and Pulumi**.
- **Purpose of the article**: Guide readers through deploying a Python application in Docker using Pulumi.

## II. What is Pulumi?

- **Description of Pulumi** and its features.
- **Comparison of Pulumi** with other infrastructure as code tools.
- **Benefits of using Pulumi** for deploying applications.

## III. Install Pulumi into Linux

If you are using vscode for this project, you can install the Pulumi extension `pulumi.pulumi-lsp-client`, to make it easier to work with Pulumi.


To get started with Pulumi, you'll first need to create an account. You can sign up for a new account on the [Pulumi website](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).

After setting up your account, the next step is to generate a Pulumi access token. Follow these steps to create your token:

1. Log into your [Pulumi account](https://app.pulumi.com/signin).
2. Navigate to the `Access Tokens` section in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on `Create a new access token`.

With your new token, you're now ready to start using Pulumi!

```shell
# Download the Pulumi tarball
curl --fail --silent --show-error --location https://get.pulumi.com | sh
export PATH=$PATH:/root/.pulumi/bin

pulumi version
```

## IV. Create a New Pulumi Project

Pulumi projects are built off of templates.  You can view the locally installed templates using `pulumi new --list-templates`.

To create a new Pulumi project, you will need to navigate to an empty folder.  You will need to have your Pulumi Access Token, project name and a stack name in mind.  Once you are ready, you can use the `pulumi new` command with the desired template. For example, to create a new Python project, you can run the command `pulumi new python`.

```shell
pulumi new python

```

## III. Setting Up the Environment

- **Prerequisites**:
    - Python and Docker installation.
    - Pulumi installation.
    - Basic familiarity with Python and Docker.
- **Creating a new Pulumi project**:
    - Initializing the project.
    - Setting up the Pulumi stack.

## IV. Building a Python Application for Deployment

- **Sample Python application structure**:
    - Code snippet or brief description.
    - Explanation of application requirements (dependencies, etc.).
- **Writing a Dockerfile for the application**:
    - Steps to create a Dockerfile.
    - Explanation of each part of the Dockerfile.

## V. Deploying the Python Application in Docker Using Pulumi

- **Defining the infrastructure as code**:
    - Creating a Pulumi script to describe the Docker container.
    - Configuring the script for Docker image and container setup.
- **Running the deployment**:
    - Step-by-step process of deploying the Python application using Pulumi.
    - Verifying the deployment.

## VI. Managing the Application

- **Monitoring and managing the deployed application**:
    - Checking container status and logs.
    - Making updates to the application or deployment configuration.
- **Scaling the application with Pulumi**:
    - Scaling out the application if necessary.
    - Modifying Pulumi code to adjust resources.

## VII. Cleaning Up Resources

- Stopping and removing the Docker container.
- Destroying the Pulumi stack.

## VIII. Conclusion

- **Summary of the key points** covered in the article.
- **Encouragement to experiment** with deploying different Python applications using Docker and Pulumi.
- **Call to action for readers** to share their experiences and challenges.

## IX. Additional Resources

- Links to further reading or resources on Docker, Pulumi, and Python deployment.
